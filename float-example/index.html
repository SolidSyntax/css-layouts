    To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
    him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
    and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
    any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
    one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
    admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
    reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
    lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
    spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
    were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
    veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
    to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
    adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
    might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
    <div id="none-floating-block"> A None Floating Block element</div>
    sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
    lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
    nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
    <div class="overflow-floating-block"> A overflowing Floating Block element</div>
    that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
    memory.
